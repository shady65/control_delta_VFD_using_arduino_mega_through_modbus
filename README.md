VFD and Encoder Controller
Overview
This Arduino sketch is designed for controlling a Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) and reading values from an encoder. The system allows for precise control of the motor's speed and direction, and it includes functionality for angle measurement using an encoder.

Components
Arduino Board
VFD (Variable Frequency Drive)
Encoder
Wires
Pin Configuration
inputSwitch: Pin 5 (Mode Selection Switch)
VFDTransmitEnable: Pin 6 (Transmitter/Receiver Mode for VFD)
incoderTransmitEnable: Pin 7 (Transmitter/Receiver Mode for Encoder)
StartPin: Pin 11 (Start/Stop Signal)
forwardPin: Pin 10 (Forward/Reverse Signal)
Constants
ERROR_VALUE: 0.02 (Error tolerance for angle correction)
Operation
Calibration Mode: Activate by pressing the mode selection switch (pin 5). It initializes and sets parameters for the VFD and encoder.

Execution Mode: The system reads encoder values, calculates the current angle, and adjusts the motor speed and direction based on the destination angle.

Test Mode: If no mode switch is pressed, the system enters test mode, displaying raw encoder values for debugging.

Functions
move_ToAngle(double destination): Moves the motor to a specified angle.
correctingAngle(): Adjusts the motor speed and direction to correct the angle.
correctingAngleFast(): A faster version of the angle correction function for real-time applications.
controlRs485(...): Sends commands to the VFD via RS485 communication.
stopFast(), moveFwdFast(), moveRevFast(): Fast control functions for motor speed and direction.
measureAngle(): Reads encoder values, calculates angles, and measures speed.
Notes
Ensure correct pin connections according to the specified pins for mode selection, transmitter/receiver modes, start/stop, and forward/reverse signals.
Adjust parameters such as maxDistance, destinationAngle, maxFrequency, minFrequency, and _delay based on your specific application.
The sketch assumes RS485 communication for VFD control and encoder connected to Serial1.
